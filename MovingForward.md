## Core Functionality

- Write down and iteratively group and categorize tasks.

## One Week Recap

I think I focused on the first part of the core functionality (write down) instead of the core of it
(iteratively group and categorize).

Yes, the concept of a thoughtboard only works if you have thoughts on the board, but
the process of grouping and categorizing those thoughts is the core goal of the process.

## Week Two

I believe the best route forward is to recreate the core of this project. Instead of focusing first on a form,
I will branch off and focus on grouping/categorizing.

| Categories                    | Thought Text      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Category1,Category2,Category3 | This is a thought |

<form>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name"/>
</form>
